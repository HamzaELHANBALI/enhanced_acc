' Connections

driver --> cc : Set Target Speed
sensors --> ts : Sensor Data
ts --> cc : Target Speed & Position
cc --> car : Throttle/Brake Command
car --> cc : Current Speed Feedback
car --> dash : Speed Data

' Notes
note right of cc : PID Controller adjusts throttle\nbased on speed error
note bottom of car : Speed Sensor provides\nfeedback to Cruise Control
note right of ts : Target Selection Module uses data\nfrom sensors to determine\ntarget speed and position
