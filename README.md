# enhanced_acc

This project is a simulation of an enhanced cruise control system that includes the ability to handle both distance and speed control.
It provides a GUI for the user to interact with the simulation and control the car's speed, inject objects into the simulation and control the distance between the car and the object.
This a follow up to the original cruise control project which was a simple system that just controlled the speed of the car : https://github.com/HamzaELHANBALI/Basic_ACC

## Features
- PID Controller for speed and distance control
- Sensor module to create objects in the car's lane
- GUI to interact with the simulation and adjust parameters in real-time
- Visualization of the simulation data and the car's behavior in regards to input parameters

## How to run
1. Clone the repository : `git clone https://github.com/HamzaELHANBALI/enhanced_acc.git`
2. Install the required packages : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main.py file : `python main.py`
4. Use the GUI to interact with the simulation and control the car's speed, inject objects into the simulation and control the distance between the car and the object. (before running the simulation, make sure to enter all the available parameters otherwise the simulation will take default values and it may be confusing to understand the results)
